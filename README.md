# 100 Days of Python in x Days

I already have some familiarity with Python and programming languages in general, but I don't consider myself particularly knowledable so I'm going through a course from start to finish in about ~_13_~ x days.

**where x &lt; 100**

I may have been a little unrealistic of how many days it would take to accomplish this course whilst everything else is going on in my life such as the work and the holidays. + the increasing difficulty of the projects...

I will be posting all my completed daily projects here.
